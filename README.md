## How It Works

1. **Input or Trigger** — The automation starts via the Appilot dashboard when the user sets monitoring preferences, account credentials, and reporting intervals.  
2. **Core Logic** — The bot navigates through Amazon Seller Central using UI Automator, capturing moderation or violation notices in real time.  
3. **Output or Action** — Logs are saved with timestamps and metadata, then exported to CSV, cloud storage, or internal databases.  
4. **Other Functionalities** — Retry mechanisms, alert systems, and advanced filters ensure accurate and efficient operation even in dynamic moderation scenarios.
